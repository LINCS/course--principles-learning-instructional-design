  <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;In Unit 1, you will discover what the research says are effective principles of learning for instructional design, based on key findings from &lt;i&gt;Improving Adult Literacy Instruction: Supporting Learning and Motivation, &lt;/i&gt;a publication which emerged from the National Research Council report, &lt;i&gt;Improving Adult Literacy Instruction: Options for Practice and Research &lt;/i&gt;(2012).  Through narrated PowerPoint presentations, subject-matter experts guide your reflection on your related knowledge and prior experience as adult learners and teachers and share their own related teaching experiences in the classroom. A short quiz helps check your comprehension of the principles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
